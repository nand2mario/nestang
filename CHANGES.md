## Version history for NESTang - an NES emulator for Tang Primer 20K

v0.8, 1/4/2024
- Supports the Sipeed Tang SDRAM v1.2 modules (v0.8rc was for MiSTer SDRAM 3.0 modules).

v0.8rc, 11/12/2023 - The Tang Primer 25k release
- This releases supports the new Tang Primer 25k, along with Tang Nano 20k.
- For primer 25k, set up the memory module, hdmi pmod, dualshock2 pmod and microsd pmod as shown in [here](doc/images/primer25k_setup.jpg).
- The primer 25k build supports the on-board USB-A port for P1, and the dualshock2 ports for P1 and P2.
- For developers - the code base has been refactored to support both boards. Use `gw_sh nano20k.tcl` to build for nano 20k, and `gw_sh primer25k.tcl` to build for primer 25k.

v0.7, 9/18/2023 - FAT32 MicroSD
- This release only supports Tang Nano 20K.

v0.6, 8/20/2023 - USB gamepads
- This release only supports Tang Nano 20K.
- USB gamepad support. In addition to playstation 2 controllers, now low-speed USB gamepads can be connected to the board. USB connectors and a bit circuitry is needed. See [usb_gamepad.md](doc/usb_gamepad.md)

v0.5, 6/4/2023 - The Tang Nano 20k release
- This release only supports the new Tang Nano 20K board.
- Direct controller support. Playstation 2 controllers (wired or wireless) can be directly 
  connected to the board through a Sipeed adapter.
- SD card support. Now games can be loaded through a MicroSD card. Use tools/nes2img.py to
  generate the SD card image. A simple menu system allows easy navigation. Press S1 button
  on the board to return to menu. 
- This is the first NESTang version that can operate standalone (without a PC). It is much 
  easier to use. At the same time, game loading and controlling through the PC loader is 
  still supported.

  1. Fixed a bug where there's no sound on some TVs.
  2. PS2 controller supports auto-fire buttons (square and triangle buttons)
